# MOYO Client Portal Implementation Documentation

## Core Functionality Implementation

* **Authentication**
    * Implemented secure client login using Auth0 (OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect)
    * JWT tokens are automatically handled through Auth0 interceptors
    * Protected routes ensure only authenticated users can access the system

* **Product Management**
    * Simple and efficient single-table product listing
    * Products are stored in PostgreSQL with basic fields (name, description, price)
    * RESTful API endpoints for retrieving product information
    * Synchronous communication pattern for immediate product data retrieval

* **Order Management**
    * Implemented full order viewing and creation capabilities
    * Asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ for order processing:
        * New orders are sent to the Order Management System via message queue
        * Order status updates are received through RabbitMQ listeners
    * Orders maintain relationships with products and store essential order information

## Technical Architecture

* **Frontend Architecture (Angular)**
    * Component-Based Architecture pattern
    * Services layer for business logic and API communication
    * Reactive state management using RxJS
    * Feature-based module organization
    * Guard-protected routing system

* **Backend Architecture (Spring Boot)**
    * Layered Architecture pattern:
        * Controllers (API Layer)
        * Services (Business Logic)
        * Repositories (Data Access)
    * Event-Driven Architecture for order processing
    * Repository pattern for data access
    * DTO pattern for data transfer

## AWS Enterprise Deployment

* **Core Services**
    * **Frontend Hosting:** AWS Amplify
        * Provides CI/CD pipeline
        * Global content delivery
        * SSL certificate management
        * Automated builds and deployments
    * **Backend Hosting:** AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
        * Enterprise-grade container orchestration
        * Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
        * Automated scaling based on demand
        * Blue-green deployment support
    * **Message Queue:** Amazon MQ 
        * Managed RabbitMQ service
        * Multi-AZ deployment
        * Enterprise-grade reliability
        * Message persistence and failover
    * **Database:** Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL
        * Enterprise-grade relational database
        * Auto-scaling capabilities
        * Cross-region replication
        * Automated backups and point-in-time recovery

## Enterprise Scaling Considerations

* Kubernetes-based container orchestration for maximum scalability
* Aurora global database for worldwide data access
* Regional deployments for reduced latency
* Multi-AZ setup for high availability
* Infrastructure as Code using AWS CloudFormation
* Monitoring and alerting through CloudWatch

## Foundation for Future Enhancements

* Modular codebase with clear separation of concerns
* Scalable database schema
* Event-driven architecture allowing for new integrations
* Containerized deployment enabling easy updates
* Authentication system supporting multiple providers
* API versioning support
* Comprehensive logging and monitoring setup

## Key Architectural Principles Applied

* **Loose Coupling**
    * Services communicate through well-defined interfaces
    * Event-driven architecture for order processing
* **High Cohesion**
    * Each component has a single responsibility
    * Clear separation between frontend and backend concerns
* **Scalability**
    * Stateless application design
    * Containerized deployment
    * Message queue for asynchronous processing
* **Maintainability**
    * Clean code organization
    * Consistent naming conventions
    * Comprehensive documentation
* **Security**
    * OAuth 2.0 implementation
    * Secure communication channels
    * Protected API endpoints
